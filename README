Watchface Steffen1

This program is my personal playground for pebble programming. It uses the
terminus font from http://files.ax86.net/terminus-ttf/.

Currently it shows the date, time, bluetooth connection state, watch battery
level and -if the corresponding android app is installed- the battery level of
the smartphone. It also show weather information for today and tomorrow. ATM
this is text only.
